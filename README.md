This is the description of every project in the repossitory.

**customer churn:**
This project aims to predict customer churn in a telecom dataset using machine learning techniques. It utilizes the XGBoost algorithm and preprocessing techniques like SMOTE for handling imbalanced data.
Key Technologies:
Python, XGBoost, scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
The XGBoost algorithm was chosen for its effectiveness in handling structured/tabular data. SMOTE was employed to address class imbalance, resulting in improved model performance.
